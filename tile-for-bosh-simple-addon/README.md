# tile-for-bosh-simple-addon

This directory contains the resources to wrap a
BOSH release with a runtime config into a
[tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-structure.html).

The tile is built via
[tile-generator](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/tile-generator/).

`package.sh` automates building the tile.
